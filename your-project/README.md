## Project Description
I've built a Russian roulette game where the player plays against 7 other computer controlled players and tries to survive. For each survived shot the player gets some money. I've also added a story as background based on my Ironhack teacher and classmates, to make it a little more fun and engaging. The basic flow of the game is:
- Introduce your name.
- Choose the gun you want to play with (each gun has a maximum number of bullets it can hold)
- Choose how many bullets you want in the gun (there has to be at least one empty slot in the barrel). The more bullets the player plays with, the smaller the chances of survival but the more money the player gets when s/he survives a shot.
- Read or skip the intro.
- Play through the first shot.
- After the first shot, which is mandatory, the player can quit at anytime after the next shot has been fired.

## Workflow
I went through 6 main steps:

1) Planning, with pseudocode and a flowchart.
2) Coding.
3) Testing all possible outcomes by running the game manually many times and fixing the bugs which came up.
4) Refactoring my code.
5) Adding some bells and whistles (features which were not necessary for the game but made it nicer or cooler).
6) Creating my presentation.

## Organization
How did you organize yourself? Did you use any tools?

I used Lucidchart to create my flowchart, and superimposing my pseudocode on it. Basically, I could decide which functions I would need to create for each step in the flowchart.
As an IDE I used Sublime Text 3
